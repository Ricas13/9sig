# Strategy engine architecture

Strategy engines accept an EngineContext and return a ProposedAction plus an explanation and proposed next state.

Implemented reusable families:
- VALUE_TARGET for signal / target strategies such as a parameterised 3Sig / 6Sig / 9Sig family
- FIXED_ALLOCATION for allocation and threshold-rebalance strategies

Definitions and versions remain data, not hard-coded routes. Proprietary configurations can therefore be disabled or replaced without redesigning the platform.

The seed enables only the value-target launch definition. Other definitions remain disabled until their regional implementations and execution workflows are production-ready.
