# Billing and entitlements

Stripe handles payment collection; Plan and Subscription records control application access.

The canonical entitlement service loads the current plan and enforces limits server-side. Free, Investor and Pro are seed data rather than conditional branches scattered through the application.

Initial seed:
- Free: 1 active strategy, in-app actions, history, reconciliation, resume, community
- Investor: 3 active strategies plus Email / Discord and analytics/comparison entitlements
- Pro: unlimited active strategies plus the same currently implemented notification and analytics features

Future features are not advertised through entitlements until their user-facing implementation exists.

## Pricing model

Plan pricing is stored in plan_prices by plan, ISO currency and cadence. Each active price record may hold its own Stripe Price ID. This allows GBP, USD, EUR or other configured prices without pretending that a converted display amount is a real Stripe price.

The older default amount fields on plans remain administrative/default metadata, while checkout always resolves an active plan_prices record for the requested currency and cadence.

Stripe webhooks resolve the canonical plan from the actual Stripe Price ID and subscription metadata. Application access is derived from the local subscription and plan entitlement records, not from scattered Stripe checks.
