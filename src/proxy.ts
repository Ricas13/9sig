// Route gate for the signed-in areas only. This file must live in src/ (the app directory is
// src/app); a copy at the repository root is silently ignored by Next.js. Marketing and SEO pages,
// the auth pages and robots/sitemap are deliberately not matched, so they stay public. API routes
// are not matched either: every handler authenticates itself and answers 401/403 as JSON.
// Revoked sessions (for example after a password reset) are detected by requirePageUser, which
// needs the database and therefore cannot run here.
// The auth configuration is built per request (so provider settings saved in the admin screen apply
// without a restart), which makes `auth(callback)` resolve to the real handler asynchronously.
