const questions=[
 ["Does the app execute investments for me?","No. You retain your brokerage account and control your own orders. The product is designed to calculate what user-selected rules imply and explain the underlying inputs."],
 ["Where do market prices come from?","A configured market-data provider supplies available quote references. A displayed exchange observation is not necessarily the exact execution price shown by your broker."],
 ["Can I correct the price I actually paid?","The intended workflow supports user-confirmed broker fills and an auditable override when price, fees or cash differ from the quote reference. Calculations must be refreshed after corrections."],
 ["When will I receive a strategy reminder?","Review dates follow the specific rules and calendar for the strategy version you chose. Available notification channels depend on plan entitlements and successful delivery configuration."],
 ["Does the app choose a strategy for me?","No. Strategies are selected by the user, and no automated broker execution is offered."],
 ["Can I use a UK ISA?","Eligibility and availability depend on the actual investment instrument, broker and account wrapper. The system must not assume that a US-listed ETF is available to UK ISA investors."],
 ["Are returns guaranteed?","No. Historical performance and simulated strategy examples do not guarantee future outcomes. Leveraged exchange-traded products can lose substantial value."]
